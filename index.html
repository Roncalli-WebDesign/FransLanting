  <section class="bio">
    <p>Frans Lanting has been hailed as one of the great photographers of
       our time. His influential work appears in books, magazines, and
       exhibitions around the world. Born in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,
       he earned a master’s degree in economics then moved to the United
       States to study environmental planning. Soon after, he began photographing
       the natural world–and never turned back.
